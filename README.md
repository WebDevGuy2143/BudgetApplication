# BudgetApplication

This is an application I learned from the Javascript course I took from Jonas Schmedtmann. 

You use the application using the form in the grey bar. 
The first selection box indicated by a minus sign or a plus sign, indicates whether an item is classified as an income (+) or an expense (-). 
The next input box is where you can specify the income/expense.
the last input box is where you type in the amount (No need to use a dollar sign. The application already displays it)

The application then displays above the input form, the totals. Income (Total) in Green, and Expense in red
The application also shows how much of a percentage is used from the total, on the expense.

Enjoy!
